        <h1>Sanjay Gandhi National Park</h1>
        <img src="..\Images\mtour3.jpg" alt="loading">
        <p>The area of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park has a long written history dating back to the 4th century BC. In
            Ancient India, Sopara and Kalyan were two ports in its vicinity that traded with ancient civilisations such
            as Greece and Mesopotamia. The 45 km (28 mi) land route between these two ports was partially passing
            through this forest.</p>

        <p>The Kanheri caves, located centrally in the park, were important Buddhist learning centres and pilgrimage
            sites sculpted by Buddhist monks (using primitive sculpting tools) between the 9th and the 1st centuries
            BCE.[6] They were chiselled out of a massive basaltic rock outcropping.[7] The monks carved exquisite
            Buddhist carvings and designs within the caves, and even had properly built spaces designated as kitchens,
            dining halls, etc., with drainages built alongside the halls.
