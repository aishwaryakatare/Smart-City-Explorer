        <p>Lalbagh Botanical Garden or simply Lalbagh (lit. 'red garden'), is an botanical garden in Bangalore, India,
            with an over 200-year history. First planned and laid out during the dalavaiship of Hyder Ali and later
            managed under numerous British Superintendents before Indian Independence. It was responsible for the
            introduction and propagation of numerous ornamental plants as well as those of economic value. It also
            served a social function as a park and recreational space, with a central glass house dating from 1890 which
            was used for flower shows. In modern times it hosts two flower shows coinciding with the week of Republic
            Day (26 January) and Independence Day (15 August). As an urban green space along with Cubbon Park, it is
            also home to numerous wild species of birds and other wildlife. The garden also has a lake adjoining a large
            rock on which a watchtower had been constructed during the reign of Kempegowda II.
