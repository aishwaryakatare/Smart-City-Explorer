                <p class="center">Pune railway station is the nearest railhead to reach the fort. Once you get down to the railway station, walk to the bus depo and take the PMT bus to the base of the fort. I would suggest you reach Swargate from Pune station which is at a distance of 15 min by bus and then take a bus to the base of the fort. Once you reach the base you will find share taxis to reach the summit point of the fort. You can also take a direct cab from Pune railway station to the fort. It takes one and half hours from the railway station to the fort</p>

                <p class="center">Sinhagad Fort is 180 km from Mumbai and 40 km from Pune. The scenic drive of the Mumbai-Pune express highway will take you to your destination. The bikes are not allowed on the express highway but, one can prefer to be on the old expressway of Mumbai-Lonavala, and then to Pune. The roads are in good condition. The final one-hour drive is through the Ghat so one has to be careful while driving.</p>
