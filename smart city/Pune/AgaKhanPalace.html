        <img src="..\Images\Aga_Khan_Palace.jpg" alt="Aga Khan Palace">
        <p>This palace was built in 1892 by Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah Agakhan III. He was elected as the President of
            the League of Nations in 1938 and was well renowned in the field of politics and sports. The palace was
            later donated to India by Aga Khan IV in 1969 as a mark of respect to Gandhiji and his philosophy.</p>
        <p><b>Historical importance:</b>
            The Aga Khan Palace Pune is a national monument of India's freedom movement. Following the launch of Quit
            India movement in 1942, Gandhiji, his wife Kasturba, and his secretary Mahadevbhai Desai were interned at the
            palace from August 9, 1942, to May 6, 1944. Mahadevbhai and Kasturba passed away while in captivity at the
            palace, and their samadhis are located on the campus. Situated near the River Mula, the palace is a simple
            memorial to Gandhi and his life.</p>
        <p><b>Tourist attraction:</b>
            The palace has developed into a national and international place of pilgrimage with over a lakh of visitors
            every year who come to pay homage to the samadhis here. The palace is surrounded by a sprawling garden. The
            famous movie 'Gandhi' was shot here.</p>
